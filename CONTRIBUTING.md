# Contributing to Escape Launcher

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Escape Launcher! We welcome contributions of all types, including bug reports, feature requests, and code contributions via pull requests.

## Reporting Issues

If you find a problem with the app, please report it in the GitHub Issues tab. Before submitting an issue, check that it doesn’t already exist. When submitting a bug report, use the bug report template and try to fill in all fields. It makes it much easier to address the issue quickly.

## Suggesting Features

Feature requests can also be submitted via the GitHub Issues tab. Check first if a similar request already exists, then submit your suggestion using the feature request template. Please note that not all requests can be implemented. Some may conflict with the app’s vision or be too complex to integrate.

## Contributing Code

To contribute code:

1. Fork the repository and make your changes on a new branch.
2. Create a pull request describing your changes.

I will review all contributions, but some may be declined if they conflict with the project’s goals or coding standards. If you’re unsure where to start, check the Projects or Issues tabs. You can comment on an issue you’re interested in and I can assign it to you.

## Contributing Financially

If you’d like to support the project financially, donations via GitHub Sponsors are greatly appreciated.

## Thank You

Any contribution, large or small, is valued. Responses may sometimes be slow, but all contributions are welcome and appreciated.
