Escape is a minimalist android launcher for android 8.1 and higher. It has a modern, simple and customizable design with a list of apps on the home screen and optional clock with widgets coming soon, support for material ui colour schemes and features such as hidden apps.

<h1>
  Building and running
</h1>

To build escape just clone the repo, open it in android studio and run with shift+f10 

To build the project you will need to create a local.properties in the project route with the sdk location in it. You will also need to add the google-services.json file or remove firebase manually.
